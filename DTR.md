#Self DTR for Slapjack

### Project
Slapjack

### Goals and Expectations
Personally, I would like to get better at separating DOM from the data model. I think this goes along with SRP and also using DRY JavaScript.

### Timeline
As of today(June 4th), I am scheduled to have my mod 1 evaluation tomorrow, Friday, June 5th. I plan to make that my priority for tonight. Starting tomorrow afternoon, I would like to have the skeleton of the HTML done by noon/1:00. I would like to get the basics of the Player and Game class done by the end of Friday. Saturday morning/afternoon I would like to complete the JavaScript that makes the game fully playable through the data model. I think this should leave Saturday night open to work on connecting the data model to the DOM, and maybe some of the DOM creation (3 decks, styling, etc). If this flows over into Sunday, that is okay, as this timeline is set to end a day early for (looking over the code and fine-tuning/refactoring). If this timeline is sufficient, I would like to work on resetting the game after win, and adding a counter to the wins of each player. That would leave Monday to work on saving player win counts to local storage, and would still give me Tuesday to refactor/clean up.
